	Dorreen and I are big fans of the SiriusXM Satellite Radio Station
“Outlaw Country”. We love the diversity of the music and
recommend it to all music lovers. It  features several shows hosted
by very talented and unusual hosts, like the truly outrageous Mojo
Nixon(Multi Talented Country Musician, Celebrity Extraordinaire) and
Elizabeth Cook (Fabulous Singer, Songwriter, Performer,Etc.), along
with a bunch of other Multi Talented Hosts. The station concentrates
on Genuine, Traditional Country Music, while throwing in some
Excellent Down Home Rock A Billy, Blues, Rock, and a whole lot more.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<span style="text-decoration: none"><span style="font-weight: normal">	While
listening to the station we discovered that “Outlaw Country”
hosts an “Outlaw Country Cruise” featuring numerous musical acts
(that are played on the station), performing on the Cruise Ship. The
first time we heard of the Cruise, it was running out of Florida, but
an up and coming Cruise would be running out of Los Angeles,
California, Nov.3 – Nov.8 (Thurs.-Tuesday), 2022. The Cruise was
billed as “Outlaw Country West”. The Route of the Cruise was from
Los Angeles, Ca., down to Cabo San Lucas, the tip of Baja Mexico. The
Ship would be anchored there for a day;</span></span><font color="#000000"><font size="3" style="font-size: 12pt"><span lang="en-US"><span style="text-decoration: none"><span style="font-weight: normal">
people could </span></span></span></font></font><span style="text-decoration: none"><span style="font-weight: normal">do
what they would like, while they were there. (The Cruise offers many
different types of On-Shore activities). From Cabo the Ship would go
North to Encenada, Mexico for another day, and then dock in
California on Tuesday, Nov.8,2022. We were interested and started to
talk about it.</span></span></p>

	We had never been on a Music Oriented Cruise before, but knew of
their existence, as coming off a Disney Cruise we saw people coming
off a Cruise Ship of a Heavy Metal Cruise. The people looked
interesting and we thought a musical cruise might be fun. We figured
we would never find out if we didn’t do it, first hand. So we
booked the trip. Full steam ahead! We were booked to Cruise on The
Norwegian Jewel.</p>

Birthday in March, we thought it might be cool to drive the Original
Historic Route66 road from Chicago to Los Angeles. This is something
we always wanted to do, and what a perfect combination of these trips
for an adventure. Thus, the vacation, </span></span><span style="text-decoration: none"><b>66

<p class="western" align="left" style="line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in">
<span style="text-decoration: none"><span style="font-weight: normal">	Since
it was only the beginning of April, 2022 we didn’t sweat it. We had
plenty of time to plan the trip.

the distance from Chicago to La. via Route66. 2448 miles. OK, I
thought. Good Start. Using my past Road Driving experience, I doubled
the amount(averaging 50 miles per hour by truck back when the speed
limit was 55), 48 hours driving. Figuring 8 hours driving a day(give
or take). 6 days. Of course, we would be stopping all over the place,
so more time would be required. But, we had the time and decided that
our adventure was feasible. If we found ourselves, lingering too long
somewhere, and running out of time, we would, simply, pull up stakes
wherever we were, and hot rod it the fastest way we could find to
make the Nov. 3 Cruise, in plenty of time. We would check out the
Internet for advice, ideas, books, maps, etc. to fill in all the
other blanks.</span></span></p>

This book suited our purpose as it is smaller in size that a regular
book(8 inches tall,5 inches wide), and could be stored easily in the
car. The book starts in Chicago taking Route 66 all the way to Los
Angeles. The book lists multiple things to see and do, while
navigating you throughout Route 66. Perfect for our trip.</span></span></span></font></p>

our spare time Dorreen and I went through the book, page by page,
state by state, making a list of things to do. We would be going
through Illinois, Missouri, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New Mexico,
Arizona, and California. We made a preliminary trip agenda.

all our research, we decided we would leave on Sunday, October 23rd

of Route66 on a couple of weekends before the actual start date of
October 23rd. We broke the Illinois part into 2 segments; from
Chicago to Joliet and Joliet to Pontiac, ending at the Route66 Museum
in Pontiac, Illinois. We actually did each segment on 2 separate
Saturdays. The first segment we did was from Joliet to Pontiac and
the second was from Chicago to Joliet. Each segment was done in 1
complete Saturday, leaving home in Crystal Lake, Illinois and
returning back home to Crystal Lake, Illinois, each Saturday. I have
listed these in geographical order(to make linear sense); Chicago to
Joliet, Joliet to Pontiac. On October 23rd we drove straight to
Pontiac, Illinois(South on Interstate355 to South Interstate55 to
Pontiac) and got on Route66 in Pontiac to begin our adventure.</span></font></span></font></p>

doing the Illinois Section of Route66 from Chicago to Pontiac (2

simply following Route66 signs. We quickly discovered that it might
be in our best interest to have some kind of Navigation App to guide
us, since it was very easy to miss Route66 signs, while winding
through old Route66 roadways. We downloaded the </span></span></font></span></font><font color="#000080"><span lang="zxx"><u><a href="https://www.route66navigation.com/"><font color="#000000"><i><span style="font-weight: normal">Route66

hindsight, the complete Route66 trip would have been very difficult;
maybe even impossible, without this App. The Route winds back and
forth all over the place and dead ends in several places, which can
be frustrating and exhausting (remember, you're driving and
concentrating). This App literally tells you when and where to turn
all throughout the Route. I sincerely recommend this App, or another
one like it if you can find one. </span></span></font></span></font>

I think that it is important to note that Historic Route66 runs
through big cities like Chicago, St. Louis, and Los Angeles. All of
these cities offer numerous adventures within their confines. If you
wished to explore these cities while traveling Route66 you could
spend at least a week in each city. You could plan a Route66 trip
including some of these cities, or all of them, if you wanted. But
you would have to carefully plan your trip with a good amount of time
devoted to any particular city along with the actual travel time
along Route66.</p>

was not our intention. Our mission was to travel the Historic Route66
and get the feel of the early route from Chicago to Los Angeles. Find
out what's been lost. What's been gained after the Interstates took
over? What's the geography like? The people? How's the Marlin Fishing
in Cabo in early November? (I've been there before and sometimes it's
excellent!)</span></span></span></font></span></font></p>
