<u><b>2 Stops</b></u></p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none">
	On this cruise the ship stopped at two ports, for people to go
ashore and do whatever. The first stop was at Cabo San Lucas, located
at the far south end tip of the Baja Peninsula in Mexico. The second
stop was, on the way back, at Ensenada, Mexico(north end of Baja
Peninsula, south of Tijuana), which is south of Los Angeles. The
cruise offers different types of excursions available at these ports.
Charter Boat fishing was offered as an excursion in Cabo San Lucas. I
had fished out of Cabo a few times and had tremendous success with
Blue Marlin Fishing, so we decided to sign up for that. We didn’t
know what to expect, since the cruise doesn’t offer many details.
Just the basics you need to know; And, of course, the price. We
booked this trip with a very open mind, not expecting too much. No
matter what, we would experience a day on the open water, which we
always enjoy.</p>

	On the day of the trip all the excursion people met in the Stardust
Theater(Beautiful Concert Hall). They checked everyone in and set us
up in shuttles to take us to our different destinations. They were
very organized and everything went very smoothly. They took us to the
Charter Boat docks and had us wait patiently for our assigned boat.
At this point we noticed that including us there were, apparently,
only 8 people signed up for Fishing. We all met each other and had a
nice conversation. We wondered how they were going to split us up,
since a Charter Boat usually takes a maximum of 6 people. After a
short wait, we were split up into 2 groups of 4. We were paired with
a wonderful couple from California.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none">
	As we all walked down the dock we all wondered what type of boat
they would put us on. There were large charter boats and well as
smaller ones, like 18 foot center consoles, all up and down the pier.
We figured they would probably put us in one of the smaller boats
(which cost less money), but were pleasantly surprised to be assigned
to a beautiful 40 foot Charter Boat, fully equipped with top notch
deep sea fishing gear.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none">
	We met the Captain and mate and found them to be very friendly and
accommodating. We were provide with lots of beer, pop, water, and
sandwiches. The Captain asked us what type of fishing we were looking
for. Totally in unison, the other couple and I said “Marlin!” We
set out to sea on a beautiful day.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none">
	80 degree weather, calm seas, great company with a ton of beer and
great food, but sadly, no fish. Blue Marlin can travel up to 70
m.p.h. , so when there in your area, chances are great for a hook up,
but when they’re not, (70m.p.h. to another location), they’re
not.

<span style="text-decoration: none"><span style="font-weight: normal">	You
might wonder why you would fish for Blue Marlin, if you’re not sure
they’re around. Simple answer, from me anyway, is that when your
trolling for Marlin, you use large squid like lures with big hooks.
(Years ago we called them feathers). While fishing for Big, Blue
Marlin, you also have a great chance of catching </span></span><font color="#000080"><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=deep+sea+fishing+posters&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_enUS913US913&amp;sxsrf=AJOqlzXnBOYuujOm3uz9JzQXyR78vzpdfw:1676215882340&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjX9u7hppD9AhWrlIkEHdBRBE4Q_AUoAXoECAEQAw&amp;biw=1920&amp;bih=969&amp;dpr=1#imgrc=qW6bEH2nA55NRM&amp;imgdii=rokj9l1vKqf7tM"><span style="text-decoration: none"><span style="font-weight: normal">other

like Sailfish, Dorado, Striped Marlin and a variety of Tunas, and
more. The fact that we didn’t catch anything, or even raise (see) a
fish is unusual; But, that’s fishing. The Captain and Crew were top
notch and did everything they could to catch us fish. I know because
in my past adventures (Occupation), I was a charter captain.</span></span></p>

	On the way back to L.A. the ship docked in Ensenada. You could leave
the ship, go on excursions, or just look around. We decided to stay
on board and relax. 
</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none">
	We hadn’t decided what route we were going to take home, so we
talked about it and decided to go home via one of our favorite spots,
Memphis, Tn. This route was just basically taking Interstate 40 all
the way across to Memphis. We figured we’d check out some stops
along the way.</p>
<p class="western" align="left" style="font-weight: normal; line-height: 100%; margin-bottom: 0in; text-decoration: none">
	The ship docked in the morning and we got ashore quickly, without
any delays. The Cruise was definitely a thumbs up experience. We
recommend it for Outlaw Country Fans.  Our car was parked real close
by. We loaded up and headed for Memphis.</p>
